# Number Guessing Game

I created this number guessing game as a way to showcase the programming skills I've been learning on my own. As I've been self-learning programming languages, I wanted to apply my knowledge by building a simple yet engaging project.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my proficiency in programming languages through the development of a game. By creating this game, I aimed to showcase the following skills:

- Utilizing JavaScript for logic and interactivity.
- Understanding of HTML and CSS for creating the user interface.
- Implementing event handling and DOM manipulation.
- Employing JavaScript functions to manage game logic.
- Utilizing random number generation and conditional statements.

## Features

- The game allows a player to guess a number between 0 and 9.
- It tracks the player's score and the current round number.

## How to Play

1. Open the game in a web browser.
2. Enter your guess in the input field provided.
3. Click the "Guess" button to submit your guess.
4. Receive feedback on whether your guess is too high, too low, or correct.
5. Continue guessing until you guess the correct number.
6. Click the "Next Round" button to proceed to the next round.

## Future Improvements

Although this game serves as a demonstration of my skills, there are several areas where I could further improve it:

- Adding animations and visual effects to enhance the user experience.
- Implementing additional difficulty levels or game modes.
- Adding sound effects or background music.
- Integrating a backend to track high scores and player statistics.
- Improving accessibility features to ensure the game is usable by a wider audience.
